Quick app I had to put up cus these absolutely slap every time Nive makes them and they go great as a side with really any noodles or other asian food, or even just as a mid-afternoon snack solo.

The soft tofu is nicely whipped up with chilli onion crunch (the brand w the old gramma on it you know the vibe), and the shishito peppers just cooked up with some lemon and garlic.
