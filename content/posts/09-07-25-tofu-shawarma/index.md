Some dinner meal prep for a few days to go along with the pasta salad that Nive made for lunch prep. She's the GOAT for whipping both of these up in a few hours before the start of the week.

**Ingredients (2 servings):**

- 16oz extra firm tofu.
- Lavash bread (Pita is an alternative but we prefer a thinner bread for this recipe).
- feta cheese
- 1 cup greek yogurt.
- 1 persian cucumber, grated.
- 1 cup red onion.
- 1 cup grape tomatoes.
- 1 tbsp dill.
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- salt and pepper to taste.

**Steps:**

[tofu cooking](tofu_cooking.jpeg)

1. Squeeze the tofu (preferably using a tofu press) to remove all excess water.
2. Using a peeler, peel the tofu into extra firm sheets, aiming for a similar thickness to deli sliced meat.
3. Cook the tofu sheets in a sauce pan until they are fairly crispy, with the olive oil, and a healthy serving of salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder and garlic power. The tofu will end up being a yellow color if it has been seasoned enough.
4. Slice the tomatoes, grate the cucumber and julienne the red onion.
5. Mix the greek yogurt, lemon juice, and water, along with a healthy portion of salt, pepper, dill and cucumber.
6. Assemble the wrap, including the tofu, tomatoes, onion, and feta cheese, served with the sauce on the side.
7. We also air-fried some french fries, with a small coat of olive oil and feta cheese.
