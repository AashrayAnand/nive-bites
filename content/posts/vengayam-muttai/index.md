Nive was craving this after she saw it on TikTok so we had to enjoy it for a Sunday brunch.
Brunch is def Nive's favorite meal to make and she's always coming up w smtg new.

I've been going on 7-8 mile runs for the last few Sundays, trying to work back into running shape and this plus a new pair of shoes got my pace a few minutes faster than the last few weeks.
