Super fun week with the boy Pavan staying at our place! Nive treated us to a super refreshing and tasty summer pasta with sungold tomatoes, and I made some espresso martinis for us to sip on the side.

Nive was super happy to have Pavan around and staying at our place for the first time! We got to go around the usual Seattle spots and enjoy the city like old times.
